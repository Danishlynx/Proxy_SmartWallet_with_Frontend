# Smart Wallet Contracts

## Overview
This project contains Solidity smart contracts for a Smart Wallet system. It includes a `SmartWallet` contract that allows users to manage their funds securely and a `SmartWalletProxy` contract for creating and managing individual `SmartWallet` instances per user.

## Features
- Proxy contract to manage the creation and destruction of smart wallet contracts.
- logic to ensure that each user gets a unique smart wallet contract address.
- A smart wallet contract that can delegate calls to other contracts like an EOA (Externally Owned Account).
- The smart wallet contract has the functionality to interact with other contracts, send and receive funds.
- the proxy contract can destroy a specific user's smart wallet contract and allow redeployment upon user request.
- Implemented functions to facilitate user interaction with the smart contracts through MetaMask
